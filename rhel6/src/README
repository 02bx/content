The input directory contains source files that generate 
SCAP content, such as XCCDF and OVAL.  Since a single large XML file 
is an impractical format for multiple authors to collaborate on 
editing SCAP content, efforts are made to keep logically related
guidance and checking content in individual files.

The transforms directory contains resources that enable the files inside
the inputs directory to be combined and reformatted into proper
SCAP formats.

The output directory is used as a storage area for the complete SCAP
content generated by the files in the inputs directory.  It should be empty
in the repository, and built on users' individual systems (and rely on
its .gitignore file to keep such files out).

The references directory should contain documents 
which are specified as references from within the SCAP content,
or documents that are "seeds," viz. documents whose prose
will be translated into SCAP formats, as well as other examples
of SCAP content.
