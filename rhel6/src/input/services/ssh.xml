<title>SSH Server</title>
<description>The SSH protocol is recommended for remote login and
remote file transfer. SSH provides confidentiality and integrity
for data exchanged between two systems, as well as server
authentication, through the use of public key cryptography. The
implementation included with the system is called OpenSSH, and more
detailed documentation is available from its website,
http://www.openssh.org. Its server program is called <tt>sshd</tt> and
provided by the RPM package <tt>openssh-server</tt>.</description>

<Rule id="ssh_server_disabled">
<title>Disable SSH Server If Possible (Unusual)</title>
<description>The SSH server service, sshd, is commonly needed.
However, if it can be disabled, do so with the command:
<br />
<pre>
# chkconfig sshd off
</pre>
This is unusual, as SSH is a common method for encrypted and authenticated 
remote access.

<Group id="ssh_server">
<title>Configure OpenSSH Server if Necessary</title>
<description>If the system needs to act as an SSH server, then
certain changes should be made to the OpenSSH daemon configuration
file <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>. The following recommendations can be
applied to this file. See the <tt>sshd_config(5)</tt> man page for more
detailed information.</description>

<Rule id="sshd_allow_only_protocol2">
<title>Allow Only SSH Protocol 2</title>
<description>Only SSH protocol version 2 connections should be
permitted, because version 1 contains security
vulnerabilities. The default setting shipped in the configuration
file is correct, but is important enough to verify.
<br />
Verify that the following line appears:
<pre>Protocol 2</pre>

<Group id="sshd_disable_extraneous_authentication">
<title>Disable Extraneous Authentication Schemes</title>
<description>OpenSSH comes with a wide variety of authentication schemes that may or may not
be applicable. It is best practice to explicitly disable all authentication schemes except for
those which are actually required. This reduces the overall attack surface of the daemon.
<br />
In the configuration file excerpt below only public key authentication (PubKeyAuthentication)
and password authentication (PasswordAuthentication) is permitted. All other schemes are disabled.
<pre>PasswordAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
GSSAPIAuthentication no
HostbasedAuthentication no
KbdInteractiveAuthentication no
KerberosAuthentication no
RhostsRSAAuthentication no
RSAAuthentication no</pre></description>

<Group id="sshd_disable_tunnel">
<title>Disable Tunneling</title>
<description>OpenSSH comes with the ability to perform tunneling utilizing a tunnel device. This allows
a user to establish a small VPN connection with a firewall/gateway machine and then access resources sitting behind that firewall/gateway machine. This feature is disabled by default but it is best to explicitly disable it if it is not needed.
<pre>PermitTunnel no</pre>

<Rule id="sshd_set_idle_timeout">
<title>Set SSH Idle Timeout Interval</title>
<description>SSH allows administrators to set an idle timeout
interval. After this interval has passed, the idle user will be
automatically logged out.
<br /><br />
To set an idle timeout interval, edit the following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> as
follows:
<br />
<pre>ClientAliveInterval <b>interval</b>
</pre>
The timeout <b>interval</b> is given in seconds. To have a timeout
of 5 minutes, set <b>interval</b> to 300.
<br /><br />
If a shorter timeout has already been set for the login
shell, that value will preempt any SSH
setting made here. Keep in mind that some processes may stop SSH
from correctly detecting that the user is idle.</description>

<oval id="sshd_idle_timeout" value="sshd_idle_timeout_value"/>
</Rule>


<Rule id="sshd_set_keepalive">
<title>Set SSH Client Alive Count</title>
<description>To ensure that the SSH idle timeout occurs precisely when the <tt>ClientAliveInterval</tt> is set, 
edit <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> as
follows:
<br />
<pre>
ClientAliveCountMax 0</pre>
<br /><br />
This ensures that a user login will be terminated as soon as the <tt>ClientAliveInternal</tt>

<Rule id="sshd_disable_rhosts">
<title>Disable .rhosts Files</title>
<description>SSH can emulate the behavior of the obsolete rsh
command in allowing users to enable insecure access to their
accounts via <tt>.rhosts</tt> files.
<br /><br />
To ensure that this behavior is disabled, add or correct the
following line:
<br />
<pre>
IgnoreRhosts yes</pre>

<Rule id="disable_host_auth">
<title>Disable Host-Based Authentication</title>
<description>SSH's cryptographic host-based authentication is
more secure than <tt>.rhosts</tt> authentication,
since hosts are cryptographically authenticated. However, it is
not recommended that hosts unilaterally trust one another, even
within an organization.
<br /><br />
To disable host-based authentication, add or correct the
following line:
<br />
<pre>
HostbasedAuthentication no</pre>

<Rule id="sshd_disable_root_login">
<title>Disable SSH Root Login</title>
<description>The root user should never be allowed to login
directly over a network, as this both reduces auditable information
about who ran privileged commands on the system and allows direct
attack attempts on root's password.
<br /><br />
To disable root login via SSH, add or correct the following line:
<br />
<pre>
PermitRootLogin no</pre>

<ident cce="4387-7" />
<oval id="sshd_permitrootlogin_no" />

<Rule id="sshd_disable_empty_passwords">
<title>Disable Empty Passwords</title>
<description>To explicitly disallow remote login from accounts with
empty passwords, add or correct the following line:
<br />
<pre>
PermitEmptyPasswords no
</pre>
Measures should also be taken to disable accounts with empty
passwords system-wide, as described in Section 2.3.1.5.</description>

<title>Enable Warning Banner</title>
<description>An earlier section contains information on how to create an
appropriate warning banner.

across the system, add or correct the following line:
<br />
<pre>

<Rule id="sshd_do_not_permit_user_env">
<title>Do Not Allow SSH Environment Options</title>
<description>To prevent users from being able to present
environment options to the SSH daemon and potentially bypass some
access restrictions, add or correct the following line:
<br />
<pre>

<Group id="sshd_using_approved_ciphers">
<title>Use Only Approved Ciphers</title>
<description>Limit the ciphers to those which are FIPS-approved and

demonstrates use of FIPS-approved ciphers in CTR mode:
<br />
<pre>
Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr

</pre>
The man page <tt>sshd_config(5)</tt> contains a list of the ciphers
supported for the current release of the SSH daemon.
