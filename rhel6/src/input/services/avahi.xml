<title>Avahi Server</title>
<description>The Avahi daemon implements the DNS Service Discovery
and Multicast DNS protocols, which provide service and host
discovery on a network. It allows a system to automatically
identify resources on the network, such as printers or web servers.
This capability is also known as mDNSresponder and is a major part
of Zeroconf networking. </description>

<title>Disable Avahi Server Software</title>
<description>Because the Avahi daemon service keeps an open network
port, it is subject to network attacks. Disabling it is
important to reduce the system's vulnerability to 
attacks from the local network.
