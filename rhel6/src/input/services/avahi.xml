<title>Avahi Server</title>
<description>The Avahi daemon implements the DNS Service Discovery
and Multicast DNS protocols, which provide service and host
discovery on a network. It allows a system to automatically
identify resources on the network, such as printers or web servers.
This capability is also known as mDNSresponder and is a major part
of Zeroconf networking. By default, it is enabled.</description>

<title>Disable Avahi Server if Possible</title>
<description>Because the Avahi daemon service keeps an open network
port, it is subject to network attacks. Disabling it is
particularly important to reduce the system's vulnerability to such
attacks.</description>
