<title>Network Time Protocol</title>
<description>The Network Time Protocol is used to manage the system
clock over a network. Computer clocks are not very accurate, so
time will drift unpredictably on unmanaged systems. Central time
protocols can be used both to ensure that time is consistent among
a network of machines, and that their time is consistent with the
outside world.
<br /><br />
Local time synchronization is recommended for all networks.
If every machine on your network reliably reports the same time as
every other machine, then it is much easier to correlate log
messages in case of an attack. In addition, a number of
cryptographic protocols (such as Kerberos) use timestamps to
prevent certain types of attacks. If your network does not have
synchronized time, these protocols may be unreliable or even
unusable.
<br /><br />
Depending on the specifics of the network, global time
accuracy may be just as important as local synchronization, or not
very important at all. If your network is connected to the
Internet, it is recommended that you make use of a public
timeserver, since globally accurate timestamps may be necessary if
you need to investigate or respond to an attack which originated
outside of your network.
<br /><br />
Whether or not you use an outside timeserver, configure the
network to have a small number of machines operating as NTP
servers, and the remainder obtaining time information from those
internal servers.</description>

<title>Configure an NTP Server</title>
<description>The site’s NTP server contacts a central NTP server,
probably either one provided by your ISP or a public time server,
to obtain accurate time data. The server then allows other machines
on your network to request the time data.
<br /><br />
The NTP server conﬁguration ﬁle is located at <tt>/etc/ntp.conf</tt>.</description>

<title>Specify a Remote NTP Server for Time Data</title>
<description>Find the IP address, server-ip , of an appropriate
remote NTP server. Edit the file <tt>/etc/ntp.conf</tt>, and add or correct
the following lines:
<br />
<pre>
restrict server-ip mask 255.255.255.255 nomodify notrap noquery
server server-ip

</pre>
If your site does not require time data to be accurate, but
merely to be synchronized among local machines, this step can be
omitted, and the NTP server will default to providing time data
from the local clock. However, it is a good idea to periodically
synchronize the clock to some source of accurate time, even if it
is not appropriate to do so automatically.
<br /><br />
The previous step disabled all remote access to this NTP
server's state data. This NTP server must contact a remote server
to obtain accurate data, so NTP's configuration must allow that
remote data to be used to modify the system clock. The restrict
line changes the default access permissions for that remote server.
The server line specifies the remote server as the preferred NTP
server for time data. If you intend to synchronize to more than one
server, specify restrict and server lines for each server.
<br /><br />
Note: It would be possible to specify a hostname, rather than
an IP address, for the server field. However, the restrict setting
applies only to network blocks of IP addresses, so it is considered
more maintainable to use the IP address in both
fields.</description>
