<title>SNMP Server</title>
<description>The Simple Network Management Protocol allows
administrators to monitor the state of network devices, including
computers. Older versions of SNMP were well-known for weak
security, such as plaintext transmission of the community string
(used for authentication) and also usage of easily-guessable
choices for community string.</description>

<title>Disable SNMP Server if Possible</title>
<description>The system includes an SNMP daemon that allows for its
remote monitoring, though it not installed by default. If it was
installed and activated, it is important that the software be
disabled and removed.
<br /><br />
If there is not a mission-critical need for hosts at this
site to be remotely monitored by a SNMP tool, then disable and
remove SNMP as follows:
<br />
<pre>
# chkconfig snmpd off
# yum erase net-snmpd</pre>
