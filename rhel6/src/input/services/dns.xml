<br />If not, disable the software and remove it from the system:
<br />
<br />
<code># chkconfig named off
<br /># yum erase bind
<br /></code>
<br />DNS software should be disabled on any machine which does not
need to be a nameserver. Note that the BIND DNS server software is
not installed on RHEL5 by default. The remainder of this section
discusses secure configuration of machines which must be
nameservers.</description>
