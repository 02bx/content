  <title>Base Services</title>
  <description>
    This section documents the services that are installed by
    default on a RHEL 6 system that was built with the
    "Minimal" package configuration. Some of these
    services are network enabled and should be treated with
    particular discretion. The other services are local
    system utilities that may or may not be extraneous
    depending upon the site configuration. Here is the output
    from the chkconfig utility showing the services that are
    installed by default on a minimal RHEL 6 system:
    <pre>

    </pre>
    As you can see, the "Minimal" package configuration in RHEL 6
    lives up to its name. The system services listed above are
    for the most part the bare essentials needed for a running system.
    Each one of these services will be discussed and a specific
    recommendation will be made as to whether the service should
    be enabled or not.

    <title>Audit Daemon (auditd)</title>
    <description>
      The audit service is provided for system auditing. By default, the service audits
      about SELinux AVC denials and certain types of security-relevant events such as
      system logins, account modifications, and authentication events performed by
      programs such as sudo.
      <pre># chkconfig auditd on</pre>
      Unless there is another application that will be used for system auditing it
      is recommended that auditd be enabled.

  <Group id="base_service_crond">
    <title>Cron Daemon (crond)</title>
    <description>
      The cron daemon is used to execute commands at preconfigured times. The cron daemon
      is required by almost all systems to perform necessary maintenance tasks. The
      daemon should be configured defensively.
      <pre># chkconfig crond on</pre>

  <Group id="base_service_firewall">
    <title>Firewall (iptables and ip6tables)</title>
    <description>
      A host-based firewall called Netfilter is included as part of the Linux kernel
      distributed with the system. It is activated by default (the services are
      enabled at boot). This firewall is controlled by the program iptables, and the
      entire capability is frequently referred to by this name. An analogous program
      called ip6tables handles filtering for IPv6. Unlike TCP Wrappers, which
      depends on the network server program to support and respect the rules written,
      Netfilter filtering occurs at the kernel level, before a program can even
      process the data from the network packet. As such, any program on the system
      is affected by the rules written.
      <pre># chkconfig iptables on</pre>
      <pre># chkconfig ip6tables on</pre>
      A well configured and monitored firewall can be considered security gold. Take
      the time to configure iptables (and ip6tables if needed).

  <Group id="base_service_lvm2-monitor">
    <title>Logical Volume Management Monitor (lvm2-monitor)</title>
    <description>
      If the system utilizes logical volumes to abstract disk storage then this service should
      be enabled.
      <pre># chkconfig lvm2-monitor on</pre>
      If LVM is not in use then this service can be disabled.
      <pre># chkconfig lvm2-monitor off</pre>

  <Group id="base_service_netfs">
    <title>Network File Systems (netfs)</title>
    <description>The Network File System is the most popular distributed filesystem
    for the Unix environment, and is very widely deployed. Unfortunately, NFS was
    not designed with security in mind, and has a number of weaknesses, both in
    terms of the protocol itself and because any NFS installation must expose
    several daemons, running on both servers and clients, to network attack.
    <pre># chkconfig ip6tables on</pre></description>
  </Group>

  <Group id="base_service_network">
    <title>Network (network)</title>
    <description>The network service is made up of a series of scripts and configuration
    files that are used to configure network interfaces upon system boot. If the system
    does not need any sort of networking then this service can be disabled. Otherwise,
    this service can be left enabled.
    <pre># chkconfig network on</pre>

  <Group id="base_service_postfix">
    <title>Postfix (postfix)</title>
    <description>
    The Postfix mail transfer agent is used for local mail delivery within the system.
    The default configuration only listens for connections to the default SMTP port
    (port 25) on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1). It is recommended to leave this
    service enabled for local mail delivery.
    <pre># chkconfig postfix on</pre>
    </description>
  </Group>

  <Group id="base_service_rhnsd">
    <title>Red Hat Update Agent (rhnsd)</title>
    <description>
      The Red Hat Update Agent is a network aware application that automatically queries
      Red Hat Network servers to determine which packages need to be updated on your machine.
      More than likely this would be an undesired behavior on production systems where patches
      must be tested before application. It is recommended to disable this service and
      perform patching in accordance with local configuration management policy.
      <pre># chkconfig rhnsd on</pre>

  <Group id="base_service_rhsmcertd">
    <title>Red Hat Subscription Manager Daemon (rhsmcertd)</title>
    <description>
      The Red Hat Subscription Manager (rhsmcertd) runs routinely to check for changes in the
      entitlements for an organization. Like the Red Hat Update Agent, it is recommended to
      also disable this service.
      <pre># chkconfig rhsmcertd on</pre>
    </description>
  </Group>

  <Group id="base_service_rsyslog">
    <title>Syslog Daemon (rsyslog)</title>
    <description>
      The rsyslog service provides the default logging daemon for RHEL 6. Unless some sort of
      custom logging daemon is used (like syslog-ng or something similar) then this service
      must be enabled and configured properly. The rsyslog service provides improvements such
      as connection-oriented (TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to database formats,
      and the encryption of log data en route to a central logging server.
      <pre># chkconfig rsyslog on</pre>

  </Group>

  <Group id="base_service_sshd">
    <title>OpenSSH Daemon (sshd)</title>
    <description>
      The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol is recommended for remote login and remote file transfer. SSH provides
      confidentiality and integrity for data exchanged between two systems, as well as server authentication,
      through the use of public key cryptography. The implementation included with the system is called
      OpenSSH. If remote administration is needed then this service should be enabled.
      <pre># chkconfig sshd on</pre>

  </Group>

  <Group id="base_service_udev-post">
    <title>Device Manager (udev-post)</title>
    <description>
      The udev service serves as the device manager. It maintains a set of devices that are normally located
      in the /dev directory. This service should be enabled.
      <pre># chkconfig udev-post on</pre>

<description>Kdump is a new kernel crash dump analyzer. It uses
kexec to boot a secondary kernel ('capture' kernel) following a
system crash. The kernel dump from the system crash is loaded into
the capture kernel for analysis.
<br /><br />
Unless the system is used for kernel development or testing,
disable the service:

interfaces to access the network. This section contains general
guidance for controlling the operation of the service. For kernel
parameters which affect networking, see Section</description>
<Group id="zeroconf_service">
<title>Disable Zeroconf Networking</title>
<description>Zeroconf networking allows the system to assign itself
an IP address and engage in IP communication without a
statically-assigned address or even a DHCP server. Automatic
address assignment via Zeroconf (or DHCP) is not recommended.
<br /><br />
To disable Zeroconf automatic route assignment in the
169.245.0.0 subnet, add or correct the following line in
<tt>/etc/sysconfig/network</tt>:
<br />
<pre>
NOZEROCONF=yes

</pre>
Zeroconf addresses are in the network 169.254.0.0. The
networking scripts add entries to the system's routing table for
these addresses. Zeroconf address assignment commonly occurs when
the system is configured to use DHCP but fails to receive an
address assignment from the DHCP server.</description>

<Group id="boot_caching_services">
<title>Boot Caching (readahead early/readahead later)</title>
<description>The following services provide one-time caching of
files belonging to some boot services, with the goal of allowing
the system to boot faster.
<br /><br />
It is recommended that this service be disabled on most
machines:
<br /><br />
<pre>
# chkconfig readahead_early off
# chkconfig readahead_later off

</pre>
The readahead services do not substantially increase a
system's risk exposure, but they also do not provide great benefit.
Unless the system is running a specialized application for which
the file caching substantially improves system boot time, this
guide recommends disabling the services.</description>

<Rule id="disable_readahead_early">

<Group id="bluetooth">
<title>Bluetooth Support</title>
<description>Bluetooth provides a way to transfer information
between devices such as mobile phones, laptops, PCs, printers,
digital cameras, and video game consoles over a short-range
wireless link. Any wireless communication presents a serious
security risk to sensitive or classified systems. Section 2.5.2
contains information on the related topic of wireless networking.
<br /><br />
Removal of hardware is the only way to ensure that the
Bluetooth wireless capability remains disabled. If it is completely
impractical to remove the Bluetooth hardware module, and site
policy still allows the device to enter sensitive spaces, every
effort to disable the capability via software should be made. In
general, acquisition policy should include provisions to prevent
the purchase of equipment that will be used in sensitive spaces and
includes Bluetooth capabilities.</description>
