<title>Print Support</title>
<description>The Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) service
provides both local and network printing support. A system running
the CUPS service can accept print jobs from other systems, process
them, and send them to the appropriate printer. It also provides an
interface for remote administration through a web browser. The CUPS
service is installed and activated by default. The project homepage
and more detailed documentation are available at
http://www.cups.org.
