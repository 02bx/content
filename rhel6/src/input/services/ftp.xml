<title>FTPServer</title>
<description>FTP is a common method for allowing remote access to
files. Like telnet, the FTP protocol is unencrypted, which means
that passwords and other data transmitted during the session can be
captured and that the session is vulnerable to hijacking.
Therefore, running the FTP server software is not recommended.
<br /><br />
However, there are some FTP server configurations which may
be appropriate for some environments, particularly those which
allow only read-only anonymous access as a means of downloading
data available to the public.</description>
