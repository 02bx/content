<description>The X Window System implementation included with the
system is called X.org.</description>

<Group id="disabling_xwindows">
<title>Disable X Windows if Possible</title>
<description>Unless there is a mission-critical reason for the
machine to run a GUI login screen, prevent X from starting
automatically at boot. There is usually no reason to run X Windows
on a dedicated server machine, since administrators can login via
SSH or on the text console.</description>
<Group id="xwindows_startx">
<title>Lock Down X Windows startx Configuration if Necessary</title>
<description>If X is not to be started at boot time but the
software must remain installed, users will be able to run X
manually using the <tt>startx</tt> command. In some cases, this runs
X with a configuration which is less safe than the default. Follow these
instructions to mitigate risk from this
configuration.</description>
<Group id="xwindows_no_listen">
<title>Disable X Window System Listening</title>
<description>To prevent X.org from listening for remote
connections, create the file <tt>/etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc</tt> and
fill it with the following line:
<br />
<pre>
exec X :0 -nolisten tcp $@

</pre>
One of X.org's features is the ability to provide remote
graphical display. This feature should be disabled unless it is
required. If the system uses <tt>runlevel 5</tt>, which is the default,
the GDM display manager starts X safely, with remote listening
disabled. However, if X is started from the command line with the
<tt>startx</tt> command, then the server will listen for new connections
on X's default port, 6000.

See the <tt>xinit(1)</tt>, <tt>startx(1)</tt>, and <tt>Xserver(1)</tt>
 man pages for more information.</description>

<Group id="xwindows_banner">
<title>Create Warning Banners for GUI Login Users</title>
<description>Edit the file <tt>/etc/gdm/custom.conf</tt>. Locate the
<tt>[greeter]</tt> section, and correct that section to contain the lines:
<br />
<pre>
[greeter]
InfoMsgFile=/etc/issue

</pre>
See Section 2.3.7 for an explanation of banner file use. This
setting will cause the system greeting banner to be displayed in a
box prior to GUI login. If the default banner font is
inappropriate, it can be changed by specifying the <tt>InfoMsgFont</tt>
directive as well, for instance:
<br />
<pre>
InfoMsgFont=Sans 12</pre>
