OVAL checks here are currently defined in individual files of 
well-formed XML, each of which contains the elements 
necessary to conduct the check.  Each file consists of one 
definition and the tests, states,
ojects and variables upon which it depends.  

Each of these XML files is concatenated and reordered to create a 
valid OVAL document.  See the Makefile for more details.

Interrogatory checks (which cannot be automated) may be defined 
in the OCIL language and stored here.

As soon as it supports newer OVAL versions, checks may also be 
defined in (or replaced by translations of) the SC language and 
compiled into OVAL using the scc tool.
