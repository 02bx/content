  <title>EARLY DRAFT Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Security Configuration Guidance (just some transformed beta RHEL 5 USGCB content, for now)</title>
  <description>This is mostly RHEL 5 USGCB XCCDF content, with "RHEL 6" slapped onto it.  
  The point of doing this is to demonstrate use of rudimentary open source tools that may be of value to SCAP content developers.  
  Transformations of a single body of XCCDF and OVAL should be capable of generating the baselines (and checking content) needed by many different parties.
  SCAP content is complicated enough, and unnecessarily forking such content is stupid, particularly when the specifications allow for a great deal of customization and transformation from a single, high-quality body of content.  
  As before, this guide is being created to assist IT professionals in effectively securing systems running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.</description>
