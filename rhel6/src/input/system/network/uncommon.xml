<title>Uncommon Network Protocols</title>
<description>The system includes support for several network
protocols which are not commonly used. Although security vul-
nerabilities in kernel networking code are not frequently
discovered, the consequences can be dramatic. Ensuring uncommon
network protocols are disabled reduces the systemâ€™s risk to attacks
targeted at its implementation of those protocols.</description>
