<Rule id="no_empty_passwords">
<title>Verify that No Accounts Have Empty Password Fields</title>
<description>Run the command:
<br />
<pre>
# awk -F: '($2 == "") {print}' /etc/shadow

</pre>
If this produces any output, fix the problem by locking each
account (see Section 2.3.1.4 above) or by setting a password.
<br /><br />
If an account has an empty password, anybody may log in and
run commands with the privileges of that account. Accounts with
empty passwords should never be used in operational
environments.</description>

<title>Verify All Account Password Hashes are Shadowed</title>
<description>To ensure that no password hashes are stored in
<tt>/etc/passwd</tt>, the following command should have no output:
<br />
<pre>
# awk -F: '($2 != "x") {print}' /etc/passwd

</pre>
The hashes for all user account passwords should be stored in
the file <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> and never in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>,
which is readable by all users.</description>
