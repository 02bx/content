<title>Protect Accounts by Restricting Password-Based Login</title>
<description>Conventionally, Unix shell accounts are accessed by
providing a username and password to a login program, which tests
these values for correctness using the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
files. Password-based login is vulnerable to guessing of weak
passwords, and to sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks against
passwords entered over a network or at an insecure console.
Therefore, mechanisms for accessing accounts by entering usernames
and passwords should be restricted to those which are operationally
necessary.</description>

<title>Restrict Root Logins to System Console</title>
<description>Edit the file /etc/securetty. Ensure that the file
contains only the following lines:
<br />
<ul>
<li>The primary system console device:
<br />console</li>
<li>The virtual console devices:
<br />tty1 tty2 tty3 tty4 tty5 tty6 ...</li>
<li>If required by your organization, the deprecated virtual
console interface may be retained for backwards compatibility:
<br />vc/1 vc/2 vc/3 vc/4 vc/5 vc/6 ...</li>
<li>If required by your organization, the serial consoles may be
added:
<br />ttyS0 ttyS1</li>
</ul>Direct root logins should be allowed only for emergency use.
In normal situations, the administrator should access the system
via a unique unprivileged account, and use su or sudo to execute
privileged commands. Discouraging administrators from accessing the
root account directly ensures an audit trail in organizations with
multiple administrators. Locking down the channels through which
root can connect directly reduces opportunities for
password-guessing against the root account. The login program uses
the file /etc/securetty to determine which interfaces should allow
root logins. The virtual devices /dev/console and /dev/tty*
represent the system consoles (accessible via the Ctrl-Alt-F1
through Ctrl-Alt-F6 keyboard sequences on a default installation).
The default securetty file also contains /dev/vc/*. These are
likely to be deprecated in most environments, but may be retained
for compatibility. Root should also be prohibited from connecting
via network protocols. See Section 3.5 for instructions on
preventing root from logging in via SSH.</description>

</ol>The su command allows a user to gain the privileges of another
user by entering the password for that user's account. It is
desirable to restrict the root user so that only known
administrators are ever allowed to access the root account. This
restricts password-guessing against the root account by
unauthorized users or by accounts which have been compromised.
<br />
<br />By convention, the group wheel contains all users who are
allowed to run privileged commands. The PAM module pam_wheel.so is
used to restrict root access to this set of users.</description>

<title>Block Shell and Login Access for Non-Root System
Accounts</title>
<description>Using /etc/passwd, obtain a listing of all users,
their UIDs, and their shells, for instance by running:
<br />
<br />
<code># awk -F: '{print $1 ":" $3 ":" $7}' /etc/passwd
<br /></code>
<br />Identify the system accounts from this listing. These will
primarily be the accounts with UID numbers less than 500, other
than root.
<br />
<br />For each identified system account SYSACCT , lock the
account:
<br />
<br />
<code># usermod -L SYSACCT
<br /></code>and disable its shell:
<br />
<br />
<code># usermod -s /sbin/nologin SYSACCT
<br /></code>
<br />These are the accounts which are not associated with a human
user of the system, but which exist to perform some administrative
function. Make it more difficult for an attacker to use these
accounts by locking their passwords and by setting their shells to
some non-valid shell. The RHEL5 default non-valid shell is
/sbin/nologin, but any command which will exit with a failure
status and disallow execution of any further commands, such as
/bin/false or /dev/null, will work.</description>

<description>This command will print all password file entries for

<br />
<br />In general, the best practice solution for auditing use of
the root account is to restrict the set of cases in which root must
be accessed anonymously by requiring use of su or sudo in almost
all cases. Some sites choose to have more than one account with UID
0 in order to differentiate between administrators, but this
practice may have unexpected side effects, and is therefore not
recommended.</description>

<title>Set Password Expiration Parameters</title>
<description>Edit the file /etc/login.defs to specify password
expiration settings for new accounts. Add or correct the following
lines:
<br />
<br />
<code>PASS_MAX_DAYS=180
<br />PASS_MIN_DAYS=7
<br />PASS_MIN_LEN=8
<br />PASS_WARN_AGE=7
<br /></code>
<br />For each existing human user USER , modify the current
expiration settings to match these:
<br />
<code># chage -M 180 -m 7 -W 7 USER
<br /></code>
<br />Users should be forced to change their passwords, in order to
decrease the utility of compromised passwords. However, the need to
change passwords often should be balanced against the risk that
users will reuse or write down passwords if forced to change them
too often. Forcing password changes every 90-360 days, depending on
the environment, is recommended. Set the appropriate value as
PASS_MAX_DAYS and apply it to existing accounts with the -M flag.
<br />
<br />The PASS_MIN_DAYS (-m) setting prevents password changes for
7 days after the first change, to discourage password cycling. If
you use this setting, train users to contact an administrator for
an emergency password change in case a new password becomes
compromised. The PASS_WARN_AGE (-W) setting gives users 7 days of
warnings at login time that their passwords are about to expire.
<br />
<br />The PASS_MIN_LEN setting, which controls minimum password
length, should be set to whatever is required by your site or
organization security policy. The example value of 8 provided here
may be inadequate for many environments. See Section 2.3.3 for
information on how to enforce more sophisticated requirements on
password length and quality</description>

<description>The command:

<br />
<br />The + symbol was used by systems to include data from NIS
maps into existing files. However, a certain configuration error in
which a NIS inclusion line appears in /etc/passwd, but NIS is not
running, could lead to anyone being able to access the system with
the username + and no password. Therefore, it is important to
verify that no such line appears in any of the relevant system
files.
<br />
<br />The correct way to tell the local system to consult network

appropriate modifications to /etc/nsswitch.conf.</description>
