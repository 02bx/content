<title>Secure Session Configuration Files for Login
Accounts</title>
<description>When a user logs into a Unix account, the system
configures the user's session by reading a number of files. Many of
these files are located in the user's home directory, and may have
weak permissions as a result of user error or misconfiguration. If
an attacker can modify or even read certain types of account
configuration information, he can often gain full access to the
affected user's account. Therefore, it is important to test and
correct configuration file permissions for interactive accounts,
particularly those of privileged users such as root or system
administrators.</description>

<title>Ensure that No Dangerous Directories Exist in Roots Path</title>
<description>The active path of the root account can be obtained by
starting a new root shell and running:
<br />
<pre>
# echo $PATH

</pre>
This will produce a colon-separated list of
directories in the path. For each directory DIR in the path, ensure
that DIR is not equal to a single . character. Also ensure that
there are no 'empty' elements in the path, such as in these
examples:
<br />
<pre>
PATH=:/bin
PATH=/bin:
PATH=/bin::/sbin

</pre>
These empty elements have the same effect as a single . character.
<br /><br />
For each element in the path, run:
<br />
<pre>
# ls -ld DIR

</pre>
and ensure that write permissions are disabled for group and
other.
<br /><br />
It is important to prevent root from executing unknown or
untrusted programs, since such programs could contain malicious
code. Therefore, root should not run programs installed by
unprivileged users. Since root may often be working inside
untrusted directories, the . character, which represents the
current directory, should never be in the root path, nor should any
directory which can be written to by an unprivileged or
semi-privileged (system) user.
<br /><br />
It is a good practice for administrators to always execute
privileged commands by typing the full path to the
command.</description>

<title>Ensure that User Home Directories are not Group-Writable or
World-Readable</title>
<description>For each human user USER of the system, view the
permissions of the user's home directory:
<br />
<pre>
# ls -ld /home/USER

</pre>
Ensure that the directory is not group-writable and that it
is not world-readable. If necessary, repair the permissions:
<br />
<pre>
# chmod g-w /home/USER
# chmod o-rwx /home/USER

</pre>
User home directories contain many configuration files which
affect the behavior of a user's account. No user should ever have
write permission to another user's home directory. Group shared
directories can be configured in subdirectories or elsewhere in the
filesystem if they are needed. Typically, user home directories
should not be world-readable. If a subset of users need read access
to one another's home directories, this can be provided using
groups.</description>
<warning category="general">Sections 2.3.4.2â€“2.3.4.5 recommend
modifying user home directories. Notify your user community, and
solicit input if appropriate, before making this type of
change.</warning>

</pre></li>
</ol>With a default <tt>umask</tt> setting of 077, files and directories
created by users will not be readable by any other user on the
system. Users who wish to make specific files group- or
world-readable can accomplish this using the chmod command.
Additionally, users can make all their files readable to their
group by default by setting a <tt>umask</tt> of 027 in their shell
configuration files. If default per-user groups exist (that is, if
every user has a default group whose name is the same as that
user's username and whose only member is the user), then it may
even be safe for users to select a <tt>umask</tt> of 007, making it very
easy to intentionally share files with group s of which the user is
a member.
<br /><br />
In addition, it may be necessary to change root's <tt>umask</tt>
temporarily in order to install software or files which must be
readable by other users, or to change the default umasks of certain
service accounts such as the FTP user. However, setting a
restrictive default protects the files of users who have not taken
steps to make their files more available, and preventing files from
being inadvertently shared.</description>
