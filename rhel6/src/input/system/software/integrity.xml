<title>Software Integrity Checking</title>
<description>
Both the AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) 
software and the RPM package management system provide 
mechanisms for verifying the integrity of installed software.
AIDE is designed to be a replacement for the well-known
Tripwire integrity checker.  The RPM package management system can 
conduct integrity checks by comparing information in its 
metadata database with files installed on the system.
<br /><br />
Integrity checking cannot
<i>prevent</i> intrusions into your system, but can detect that
they have occurred.  Requirements for software integrity checking may be 
highly dependent on the environment
in which the system will be used.

<title>Verify Integrity with AIDE</title>
<description>AIDE conducts integrity checks by comparing information
about files with previously-gathered information, which it stores in a 
database (to use the term loosely; it's really just data inside a file).
Ideally, the AIDE database would be built before the
system is connected to any network, though this may prove
impractical due to registration and software updates.
AIDE is highly configurable.  This advice is based on information
provided in its documentation available in 
<tt>/usr/share/doc/aide-VERSION</tt></description>

<Rule id="install_aide">
<title>Install AIDE</title>
<description>
Install the AIDE package with the command:
<pre>
# yum install aide</pre>
</description>
<rationale>
The AIDE package must be installed if it is to be available for integrity checking.

<Rule id="disable_prelink">
<title>Disable Prelinking</title>
<description>
The prelinking feature 
changes binaries in an attempt to decrease their startup time. 
In order to disable it, change or add the following line inside the file <tt>/etc/sysconfig/prelink</tt>:
<pre>
PRELINKING=no 
</pre>
Next, run the command
<pre>
# /usr/sbin/prelink -ua 
</pre>
to restore binaries to a normal, non-prelinked state.  
</description>
<rationale>
The prelinking feature can interfere with the operation
of AIDE, because it changes binaries. 
</rationale>
</Rule>

<Rule id="aide_build_database">
<title>Build and Test AIDE Database</title>
<description>Run the following command to generate a new database:
<pre>
# /usr/sbin/aide --init</pre>
By default, the database will be written to the file <tt>/var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz</tt>.
Storing the database, the configuration file <tt>/etc/aide.conf</tt>, and the binary 
<tt>/usr/sbin/aide</tt> (or hashes of these files), in a secure location (such as on read-only media) provides additional assurance about their integrity.
The newly-generated database can be installed as follows:
<pre>
# cp /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz</pre>
To initiate a manual check, run the following command:
<pre>
# /usr/sbin/aide --check</pre>
If this check produces any unexpected output, investigate.
</description>
<rationale>
For AIDE to be effective, an initial database of "known-good" information about files
must be captured and it should be able to be verified against the installed files.
</rationale>
</Rule>

<Rule id="aide_periodic_cron_checking">
<title>Configure Periodic Execution of AIDE</title>
<description>
AIDE should be executed on a periodic basis to check for changes.
To implement a daily execution of AIDE at 4:05am using cron, add the following line to /etc/crontab:
<pre>
05 4 * * * root /usr/sbin/aide --check
</pre>
AIDE can be executed periodically through other means; this is merely one example.
</description>
<rationale>
By default, AIDE does not install itself for periodic execution.  Periodically 
running AIDE may reveal unexpected changes in installed files.

<Group id="rpm_verification">
<title>Verify Integrity with RPM</title>
<description>The RPM package management system includes the ability
to verify the integrity of installed packages by comparing the
installed files with information about the files taken from the
package metadata stored in the RPM database. Although an attacker
could corrupt the RPM database (analogous to attacking the AIDE
database as described above), this check can still reveal
modification of important files.

To list which files on the system differ from what is expected by the RPM database:
<pre>
# rpm -qVa</pre>
See the man page for <tt>rpm</tt> to see a complete explanation of each column.

<Rule id="rpm_verify_permissions">
<title>Verify File Permissions with RPM</title>
<description>The RPM package management system 
can check the permissions of thousands of installed files, including
many that are important to system security.

The following command will list which files on the system have permissions that are different 
from what is expected by the RPM database:
<pre>
TODO/FIXUP: # rpm -qVa | awk -F='' $2="M" {print $0}'</pre>

<Rule id="rpm_verify_hashes">
<title>Verify File Hashes with RPM</title>
<description>The RPM package management system 
can check the hashes of thousands of installed files, including
many that are important to system security.
To list which files on the system have hashes that differ from what is expected by the 
RPM database (except for configuration files, which may be expected to change):
<pre>
TODO/FIXUP: select only files with a "5" in 3rd column
# rpm -qVa | awk '$2!="c" {print $0}'
</pre>
A “c” in the second column indicates that a file is a configuration file.
