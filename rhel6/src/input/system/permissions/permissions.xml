<title>File Permissions and Masks</title>
<description>Traditional Unix security relies heavily on file and
directory permissions to prevent unauthorized users from reading or
modifying files to which they should not have access. Adhere to the
principle of least privilege â€” configure each file, directory, and
filesystem to allow only the access needed in order for that file
to serve its purpose.
<br />
<br />Note: Several of the commands in this section search
filesystems for files or directories with certain characteristics,
and are intended to be run on every local ext2 or ext3 partition on
a given machine. When the variable
<em>PART</em>appears in one of the commands below, it means that
the command is intended to be run repeatedly, with the name of each
local partition substituted for
<em>PART</em>in turn.
<br />
<br />The following command prints a list of ext2 and ext3
partitions on a given machine:
<br />
<br />
<code>$ mount -t ext2,ext3 | awk '{print $3}'
<br /></code>
<br />If your site uses a local filesystem type other than ext2 or
ext3, you will need to modify this command.</description>
