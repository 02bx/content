<title>Restrict Partition Mount Options</title>
<description>System partitions can be mounted with certain options
which limit what files on those partitions can do. These options
are set in the file <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>, and can be used to make certain
types of malicious behavior more difficult.</description>

<Rule id="mountopt_nodev_on_nonroot_partitions">
<title>Add nodev Option to Non-Root Local Partitions</title>
<description>The <tt>nodev</tt> mount option prevents files from being
interpreted as character or block devices. Legitimate character and block
devices should exist in the <tt>/dev</tt> directory on the root partition or
within chroot jails built for system services. All other locations should not
allow character and block devices.
<br /><br />
The one exception to this rule is the existance of chroot jails located
on a partition other than the root partition. In this case, it is not
advised to set <tt>nodev</tt> on these filesystems.</description>

<description>The <tt>nodev</tt> mount option prevents files from being

<Rule id="mountopt_noexec_on_removable_partitions">
<title>Add noexec Option to Removable Media Partitions</title>
<description>The <tt>noexec</tt> mount option prevents the direct
execution of binaries on the mounted filesystem. Users should not
be allowed to execute binaries that exist on partitions mounted
from removable media (such as a USB key). The <tt>noexec</tt>
option prevents code from being executed directly from the media
itself, and may therefore provide a line of defense against
certain types of worms or malicious code.</description>

<Rule id="mountopt_nosuid_on_removable_partitions">
<title>Add nosuid Option to Removable Media Partitions</title>
<description>The <tt>nosuid</tt> mount option prevents set-user-identifier (suid)
and set-group-identifier (sgid) permissions from taking effect. These permissions
allow users to execute binaries with the same permissions as the owner and group
of the file respectively. Users should not be allowed to introduce suid and guid
files into the system via partitions mounted from removeable media.</description>

<title>Bind-mount /var/tmp to /tmp</title>
<description>The <tt>/var/tmp</tt> directory should be bind mounted to <tt>/tmp</tt>
in order to consolidate temporary storage into one location protected by the same
techniques as <tt>/tmp</tt>. This is done by editing <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> and adding
the following line if needed:
<pre>
/tmp     /var/tmp     none     rw,nodev,noexec,nosuid,bind     0 0

</pre>
See the mount(8) man page for further explanation of bind mounting.
