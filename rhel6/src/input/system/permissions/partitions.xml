<title>Restrict Partition Mount Options</title>
<description>System partitions can be mounted with certain options
which limit what files on those partitions can do. These options
are set in the file /etc/fstab, and can be used to make certain
types of malicious behavior more difficult.</description>

<Rule id="mountopt_nodev_on_nonroot_partitions">
<title>Add nodev Option to Non-Root Local
Partitions</title>
<description>The nodev option prevents users from mounting
unauthorized devices on any partition which is known not to contain
any authorized devices. The root partition typically contains the
/dev partition, which is the primary location for authorized
devices, so this option should not be set on /.</description>

<title>Add nodev Option to Removable Media
Partitions</title>
<description>Users should not be allowed to introduce arbitrary
devices or setuid programs to a system. These options are used to
prevent that. In addition, while users are usually allowed to add
executable programs to a system, the noexec option prevents code
from being executed directly from the media itself, and may
therefore provide a line of defense against certain types of worms
or malicious code.</description>
