This is an explanation of the directory structure of this 
folder, in an attempt to maintain order.

The src directory should contain those source files that generate 
SCAP content, such as XCCDF and OVAL, as well as these files
themselves.  It seems unlikely that a single large XML file 
will prove to be a practical format for multiple authors to
create SCAP content, so we expect this folder to contain directories
as well as tools that support transformation of the content
into its intended form (which must be large XML files in the 
SCAP formats).

The reference_docs directory should contain those documents 
which are specified as references from within the SCAP content,
or documents that are "seeds," viz. documents whose prose
will be translated into SCAP formats.

The deployment_resources directory should contain items that 
allow administrators to become compliant with the baselines
that are defined here.  This includes, but is not limited to, 
kickstart files, puppet modules, and info on Satellite Server 
integration.
